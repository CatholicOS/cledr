## What is CLEDR?

The Catholic Open Source Common Liturgical Events Data Repository (CLEDR) provides a canonicalized list of identifiers for liturgical celebrations (or events)
that are defined by the Roman Missal Editio Typica, in both the [Temporale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporale) and the [Sanctorale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctorale).

The [Editio Typica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editio_typica) of the Roman Missal is the official source for the celebrations of the liturgical year,
and all language editions of the Roman Missal are based off of the Latin Editio Typica published by the [Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments](https://www.cultodivino.va/en.html).

The Roman Missal is a living source, inasmuch as it can be revised and new editions can be published.
Liturgical celebrations from the Temporale and the Sanctorale cycles can be added or removed from one edition to the next.
Consequently, the CLEDR will need to be revised with each new edition of the Latin Roman Missal.
The year in which any given Editio Typica or revised edition of an Editio Typica was published shall be a sub-property of all canonicalized ids in the CLEDR.
